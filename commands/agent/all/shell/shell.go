		"For macOS and Linux, the /bin/sh shell is used with the -c argument. Use the run command to execute a program " +
		"directly without invoking the shell.\n\n" +
		"\tShell Functions\n\n" +
		"\tSome commands and capabilities are components of a shell and can ONLY be used with a shell. For example, the " +
		"'dir' command is a component of cmd.exe and is not its own program executable. Therefore, dir can only be used" +
		" within the cmd.exe shell.\n\n" +

		"\tQuoted Arguments\n\n" +
		"\tWhen running a command on an agent from the server, the provided arguments are passed to executable that was " +
		"called. As long as there are no special characters (e.g., \\ , & , ; , | , > , < etc.) the command will be " +
		"processed fine.\n\n" +
		"\tFor example, this command will work fine because it does not have any special characters:\n\n" +
		"\tMerlin[agent][c1090dbc-f2f7-4d90-a241-86e0c0217786]» shell powershell.exe Get-Service -Name win* -Exclude WinRM\n\n" +
		"\tHowever, this command WILL fail because of the | symbol. The command will still execute, but will stop " +
		"\tprocessing everything after the | symbol.\n\n" +
		"\tMerlin[agent][c1090dbc-f2f7-4d90-a241-86e0c0217786]» shell powershell.exe Get-Service -Name win* -Exclude WinRM | fl\n\n" +
		"\tTo circumvent this, enclose the entire argument in quotes. The outer most quotes will be removed when the " +
		"arguments are passed. The argument can be enclosed in double quotes or single quotes. All other quotes need to " +
		"be escaped The command be executed in both of these ways:\n\n" +
		"\tMerlin[agent][c1090dbc-f2f7-4d90-a241-86e0c0217786]» shell powershell.exe \"Get-Service -Name win* -Exclude WinRM | fl\"\n\n" +

		"\tEscape Sequence\n\n" +
		"\tFollowing along with the Quoted Arguments section above, the \\ symbol will be interpreted as an escape " +
		"sequence. This is beneficial because it can be used to escape other characters like the pipe symbol, | . " +
		"However, it can work against you when working with Windows file paths and the arguments are not enclosed in quotes.\n\n" +
		"\tThis command will fail because the \\ itself needs to escaped. Notice the error message shows File Not Found:\n\n" +
